			<div class="text">Ade had just started his digital marketing business in 2021 and he realized that he needed to advertise his business if he wanted more clients.
           
So he decided to run some adverts for his business.

He ran ads consistently for 3months using Facebook and Instagram but he got very low results from it.

Although 500 people saw the advert, only 100 clicked the link and at the end of the day, he'll have to wait for almost a month retargeting his ads before 20% of that number will pay to get his services.

He wondered why.

He was always able to get clients through referrals but he knew that if he wanted a greater amount of clients, he'll need to advertise.

But strangely, the response he got from his adverts wasn't encouraging at all.

One of the dilemmas an entrepreneur faces is this - you are willing to sacrifice your money to advertise your business but then there's no great profit or result.

Some put the blame on the platform they advertise on, some put the blame on their advertisers.
			</div>
		</section>
		<section class="section-3">
			<span class="title">
				Why Did This Happen Despite
				<br />
The Fact That He Used Facebook?
			</span>
			<div class="text">
It is lack of powerful offers.

Ade had the courage, the money and consistency that he could invest in advertising his business.

But he didn’t know how to create offers that results in immediate sales.

There are so many like that in the business world, suffering silently and hoping that maybe someday their advertising would yield results.

Because of their offers are not unique, they either have no clients or they just get a little success by reducing their prices.

			</div>
		</section>
		<section class="section-4">
			<u class="title">Is It Even Worth It For <br>Ade To Advertise Anymore?</u>
			<div class="text">
Just by calculating how much Ade lost from his adverts, we can see that something needs to change.

Ade advertises four times a year using a budget of 20,000naira.

Now let's multiply that figure by four to see how much he will lose in a year.

20,000naira X 4 = 80,000naira

If the advertisments brings no profit within two years time, Ade would have spent 160,000naira that could have been spent for other parts of his business.

Unsuccessful advertising is one of the reasons a business grows bankrupt and eventually shuts down.

But you know what?
You can stop that from happening...

			<div class="title">Who Am I Anyways?</div>
			<div class="text">   
Now it's time for introduction.
<img src="Images/me.png" class="pic" />
My name is Sophia Oladapo, I am a landing page copywriter with fictional storytelling as my best weapon.

In case you're wondering why I look so young, I'm 14 years old...

Surprised?

I actually started when I was 13 years old and for one year now I have worked as a copywriter, written more than 15 powerful copy, headlines and..

Received compliments from copywriters who know their work well and have gotten great results such as Sunny Melar Fileme, Abdulhameed Abdur-Rahman(Elephchild), the CEO Of Maneki- Yasaman Rajaee and many others.

	
<img src="Images/Testimonials1.jpg" class="pic">
<img src="Images/Testimonial.jpg" class="image">
	 
Currently I'm honing my skill in creating enticing yet compelling fictional stories.

Having spent almost a year in this copywriting business, I can say that I have seen the evils that unsuccessful advertising could cause.
				
It causes discouragement, wastage of resources and at the end of the day, you can't stop blaming yourself on spending that money with no profit gained.

In January 2022, I had invested my money into advertising on Whatsapp for one of my lead magnets in order to generate leads.

Result? Only 5 people clicked the link.

We should all hate this, advertising with no success.
				
But then a few months earlier, I had done the same advert and gotten almost a 100 leads.
Why did this happen?

I then searched for a model I could follow that will make sure that my advertisements are always successful and that I make sales (which is basically what we all want).

			</div>
		</section>
		<section class="section-4">
			<div class="title">And I found this:</div>
			<img src="../images/Advert-pic1.png" class="picture" />

			<br />

			<div class="text">Now I know that you don't understand now, but you'll soon know what it means.
Just stay with me for a while.
         
I came upon a book called "100m Offers By Alex Hormozi".

That was where I found the picture above.

Alex Hormozi is one of those special and expert entrepreneurs that helps his clients generate millions of dollars every month using what he calls "Grand Slam Offers'.

These are offers that make people to rush to you with their money and happily pay you even when the price is high.


Alex told the story of one of his companies who helped save one agency from unsuccessful advertising..

The agency was an advertising agency that helped businesses in generating leads and retaining them.

In terms of advertisement, this agency was like any other.

Sometimes they made sales and most times the success of their adverts were very low, which led them to reducing their prices.

And usually it was because their offer was not enticing.

They offered to advertise for their clients and they had no guarantee for their customers that they will get a return on their money.

Also their clients will have to pay recurring fees.

So they decided to do something different.
They created a Grand Slam Offer that was pretty simple and the results were impressive.

They made use of what copywriters call "Risk Reversals" to make their offers much powerful.
</div>			
			<br>
			<div class="title">All they did was change <br>the words and this happened:	
</div>
<img src="../images/Advert-pic.png" class="picture" />
			<br>
			<div class="text">In the box above, he showed the difference between the two offers used. 
The old one was called "Commodity" and the new offer that produced better results was called "Grand Slam".
   
With the original offer, they spent $10,000 and although they got 300,000 impressions, only 40 people out of that number actually booked an appointment.

And out of that number, only 30 people showed up, eventually only "5" paid for the service.

But when they used the offer above, they got 100 people to book an appointment from among the same 300,000 impressions.

75 people showed up and 28 people agreed to the deal at the end.

Because there was no recurring fees, they could charge 4X more for their services.

<b>However note that it was the same money that was spent on advertising that gave a much more better result.</b>
            
Over and over again, this model of creating "Grand Slam Offers" never failed them.

I tried it out on a Facebook Group and it worked like magic.

I got almost a 100leads for free from just using Grand Slam offers on a Facebook group.

But for some people, this is not the case.

Instead of having people click the link, their advert just lies there, wasting away.
 
Which is why I decided to organize a challenge I call.…

5. If your sales indeed do double, I and the five hosts are to be given 40% of the profit as commission for our great work.

      			<label for="section-1" class="accordion_label">What's the guarantee that you and the hosts will double my sales? And what will happen if you fail to do as you say?</label>
      			<div class="accordion_content"><p>The guarantee is we won't be following a model that's unknown and uncertain but the model of Grand Slam offers that have been known for success before.

Also I and the hosts have used this method before with success.

Favour Akam, one of the hosts of the challenge oncetripled the sales of one his clients, a cosmetic brand by simply changing their offers and using the model of Grand Slam Offers.

I almost tripled my click-through-rate on my YouTube channel when I used Grand Slam offers for the title and thumbnails of my videos.

So the certain to happen part is that your sales will be doubled.

The unlikely part is that after the 30days, your sales don't increase nor double.

And if your sales aren't doubled after the 30 days challenge, you won't have to pay us anything and we will also give you the sales funnel we created for you in the challenge for free, to change to your desire.

When you calculate the worth of everything we'll be creating for you in this challenge, we have practically repaid your advertising budget 6X more. 

All you have to provide is an advertising budget of 10,000 naira to pay for advertisement expenses and many others which when calculated is actually more than 10,000naira.

      			<label for="section-2" class="accordion_label">If I don't have a digital product but a physical one, can I join?</label>
      			<div class="accordion_content"><p>No, the main people we chose to work with in this challenge are entrepreneurs with digital skills and products e.g course creators, graphic designers.

      			<label for="section-3" class="accordion_label">Why can't the challenge be free?</label>
      			<div class="accordion_content"><p>The hosts invited to this challenge (including me) on a normal day charge between 10,000naira to 50,000naira to write a sales copy because of how good they are at their work.

But in this challenge you'd be getting a sales copy, graphics, landing page design and a sales funnel for 10,000naira.

Would it be fair to us the hosts, if we get absolutely nothing but 10,000naira for helping five persons to double their sales in 30days?

Despite all the expenses, all the time, data and effort spent?

Even you don't work for free, your clients pay you in exchange for your work, then why should a challenge as great as this be free?

Also isn't it worth it to spend your advertising budget you were going to spend whether the DYS Challenge existed or not with greater results?

      			<label for="section-4" class="accordion_label">I don't really understand the 40% commission and advertising budget thing you talked about earlier</label>
      			<div class="accordion_content"><p>The 40% is the amount of money I and the hosts will be paid if your sales are doubled, it will be calculated from the whole sales you earned during the challenge.

For example, let's say on average you earned 50,000naira when you advertised any of your digital products.

During the challenge, you then earn double which is 100,000naira.
We the hosts will get 40% of the 100,000naira which is:

40% of 100,000naira which would equal 40,000naira.

So we'll be paid 40,000naira</p>
