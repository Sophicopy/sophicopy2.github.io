            Generating Traffic Is Quite Difficult But Retaining Them And Building Them Into Highly-Converted Clients Is Harder.
          <br>

          John Stuart Hill once said "There is no 'one-size-fits-all' way to build an audience".
          In other words you can't use the same strategy you used to build Audience A to build Audience B, they are different in their personalities, in their language and in their level of understanding.
          It's time to get deep and understand your audience, for they that understand their audience, yea even they shall prosper among them.
              <br>
          So a recipe for disaster in traffic generation is having a one-size-fits-all way of doing things.
