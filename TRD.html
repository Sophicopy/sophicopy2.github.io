           	This is different from other false information that is spread out, this are tested and proven strategies that I have used for the past two years now to generate traffic and I have found them to always work. <!--to be used towards the end-->

             <h2>
             	Acting desperate in this business world makes you look more like a needy person, than the needed person.
             	<br>
             	<br> Spamming groups are just one of the many signs of desperation, and to be frank people find it easier to look down on people who do such things, in other words you've lost their respect.
             	<br>
             	<br>
             	Spamming leads to high distrust and loss of respect which eventually equals to <b>"no clients" which leads us to "no sales"
             	</b>
             	<br>
                   
             <br>
                 But you might say "indeed,I spammed someone's group but people joined"
                 if they join and you try to sell something to them, there's a high probability that they'll not trust you enough to buy from you.  
                 And for sure that is the last thing you want to happen.
                 <br>

                 DISCLAIMER:
                  Some of you here might be guilty of spamming and most of you hopefully are not spammers but please bear with me if you're not a spammer, I need to explain the disadvantages of spamming to our fellow human beings that are spammers.

                  	And what's worse, if we are with our friends, we see you somewhere and recognise you, we'll tell our friends that you are a "spammer" which taints your reputation and brand even more.
                  	<br>
                  	That is a negative recognition, you wouldn't want people to remember you with that.

                 	We'll think of you as someone with no manners, since you spammed a group without complete permission from the admin of the group.
